##Questions
Is this only one train? If yes, timestamp is sufficient.
Who is this system for? Maintenance team?



##Ideas
RSI forecast for every point of the track
Current health status for every point of the track
Try to find out the possible reasons for the bad signal
Give detailed info, about what exactly is wrong with a signal or why do we expect it to fail soon.
Cluster or categorise errors
Other measurements for quality than SNR?
Correlations of problems to (weather, date, time, what is next to the track there, etc.)



#Howto
Check data quality
- do the gps data fit to train tracks?
- do gps differences fit to train speed?
For analytics, use track kilometer instead of gps, because 1d ist easier than 2d. For visualisation then map to gps




Signal strength != telegram lost rate. Schranken liegt das Kabel unterm asphalt, maps api!

3.0v signal = problem

3s & 15meter = stop emergency

Forecast ab wann?

Cow fence heisst gutes signal aber viele drops, saisonal!


Remove lines, where train does not move
32k track, Break it down to 100m intervals (use stations 9 to 40)
Average per interval per tour
